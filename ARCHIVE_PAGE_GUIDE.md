# Archive Page User Guide

## Overview
The Archive Page has been completely refined to provide a seamless, easy-to-use search experience for browsing through all archived jobs. The new design focuses on powerful search capabilities while maintaining the same double-click functionality as the active jobs table.

## Key Features

### üîç **Powerful Search Bar**
- **Location**: Prominent search bar at the top of the page

  - Inlay type
  - Label size
  - Quantity
  - Status
  - UPC number
  - Serial number
  - Due date
- **Real-time Results**: Search updates automatically as you type (with 300ms debouncing)
- **Case Insensitive**: Search works regardless of capitalization

### üìä **Smart Stats Display**

### üéØ **Quick Filters**
- **Customer Filter**: Dropdown populated with all unique customers from archived jobs
- **Clear Button**: Instantly clear search and reset all filters
- **Removed**: Status filter (no longer needed since all archived jobs have archived status)

- **Toggle Button**: "Show Date Filters" / "Hide Date Filters"
- **Date Range**: Filter by archive date range (from/to)
- **Reset Button**: Reset dates to default range (last year to today)

### üìã **Enhanced Results Table**

### üñ±Ô∏è **Interaction Features**
- **Double-click**: Open job details dialog (same as active jobs table)

- **Read-only Details**: Archived job details are view-only (editing disabled)

## Tips for Efficient Use

### üéØ **Search Strategy**

- Use partial matches (e.g., "Peak" instead of "Peak Technologies")
- Search by any data point you remember (customer, numbers, dates, etc.)

### üîß **Filter Combinations**
- Combine search with customer filter for targeted results
- Use date filters when looking for jobs from specific time periods
- Filter by customer and then search within those results

### üì± **Performance**
- Search is optimized with debouncing for smooth typing
- Results update quickly even with large archives
- Stats keep you informed of result counts

### üóÇÔ∏è **Organization**
- Sort by any column to organize results
- Use customer filter to focus on specific clients
- Date filters help with periodic reviews
- Archived Date column shows when jobs were moved to archive

## Technical Notes

### Data Sources
- Loads archived jobs from individual `job_data.json` files in archive folders
- Supports both old and new field naming conventions
- Handles data format changes gracefully

### Performance Features
- Debounced search prevents excessive filtering while typing
- Efficient in-memory filtering for fast results
- Smart loading only reads necessary data

### Compatibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing archive structure
- Works with jobs archived from the refined job system
- Handles various data field formats and naming conventions

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Found
- Check if search term is spelled correctly
- Try broader search terms
- Verify date filters aren't too restrictive
- Use "Clear" button to reset all filters

### Missing Jobs
- Ensure jobs were properly archived (not just deleted)
- Check that archive directory is accessible
- Verify job folders contain `job_data.json` files

### Slow Performance
- Large archives (1000+ jobs) may take a moment to load initially
- Search and filtering remain fast regardless of archive size
- Consider using filters to narrow results for better navigation

## Future Enhancements

The refined archive page provides a solid foundation for additional features such as:
- Export filtered results to CSV/Excel
- Bulk operations on selected jobs
- Advanced search with field-specific criteria
- Archive statistics and reporting
- Integration with external reporting tools

File Templates Should follow this pathing 

Label Size -> Customer -> UPC (If no size- Read out stating "Template creation Required") 
This would help get rid of the files changing from person to person when making new jobs and help from having more "Locking Issues" 

Need Added is the QTY with the overage so if needed we can pull and stage the correct amount of mats.

Need to add a print page for checklist for QA and Roll Tracker (Multi Selection) 

Need to add a layout button that would then select from basic template if the customer template doesn't exist 
	(Based on our customers stock items) 

Need to add / Pong for Very important update Coming Soon!

Refreshing Timer / Causing Lag
